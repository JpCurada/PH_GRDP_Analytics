# Philippine GRDP Analytics

The Philippine Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a measure of the total economic output of the Philippines, including the value of all goods and services produced in the country. It is the most widely used indicator of the economic performance of a country and is often used to compare the economic growth of different countries. The GDP of a region, such as the Gross Domestic Product of the Philippines, is often referred to as the Gross Domestic Product at Regional Prices (GDPRP). The GDPRP is calculated by measuring the value of all goods and services produced in a region, regardless of where they are consumed. It is a measure of the economic output of a region and is used to compare the economic performance of different regions within a country.

This dashboard aims to help data analysts and economists in analyzing Gross Domestic Regional Product (GRDP) of regions within the Philippines from 2000 to 2021.
